Automated Role Management - Multiple Tiers, Auto-Demote on Level Drops
Sync MLBB ranks with Discord roles.

Implementation:
Define tiers (e.g., "Warrior", "Mythic") mapping to MLBB ranks.
In Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB), players climb through seven primary rank tiers. Progress is generally tracked using a star system, except for the highest tiers, which use a points-based star system. 
The ranks from lowest to highest for 2025 are as follows:
1. Warrior
The starting rank for all new players. 
Divisions: Warrior III to Warrior I.
Requirement: 3 stars to advance each division.
Note: You do not lose stars upon defeat in this tier. 
2. Elite
Divisions: Elite IV to Elite I.
Requirement: 3 to 4 stars per division. 
3. Master
Divisions: Master IV to Master I.
Requirement: 4 stars per division. 
4. Grandmaster
Divisions: Grandmaster V to Grandmaster I.
Requirement: 5 stars per division. 
5. Epic
Widely considered the "gatekeeper" rank where competitive play intensifies. 
Divisions: Epic V to Epic I.
Requirement: 5 stars per division.
Feature: Unlocks Draft Pick mode, where each team can ban heroes. 
6. Legend
Divisions: Legend V to Legend I.
Requirement: 5 stars per division. 
7. Mythic & Beyond
Once you reach Mythic, you no longer have numerical divisions (like V or I). Instead, you accumulate stars to reach prestigious sub-tiers. 
Mythic: The entry level of the highest tier (0–24 stars).
Mythical Honor: Reached at 25 stars.
Mythical Glory: Reached at 50 stars.
Mythical Immortal: The highest possible rank, reached at 100 stars
On verify or periodic check (cron job), assign/remove roles based on current rank .
